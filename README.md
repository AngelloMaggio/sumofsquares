# sumofsquares
A Flask server implementation to make a query that will yield the
difference between the sum of the squares of the first n natural
numbers and the square of the sum of the same first n natural
numbers, where n is guaranteed to be no greater than 100.

Example:

n=10

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is:

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is:

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

 A natural number is a positive integer (whole numbers)
 e.g. 1, 2, 3, .. 100, etc.
